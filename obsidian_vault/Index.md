Hello, My name is *Sarang*, in this place I store my DevOps Notes, assignments and Practical. Its not much but I like to keep track of everything I learned. 

This Place also acts like a **Second brain** kinda thing where I can always go back in time and recollect my old thoughts and Ideas. Its not perfect and thats the beautify of it. I like to keep it this way original and imperfect. 

In this **Digital Garden** you are always welcome to explore and share your notes too if you want or [contribute/give suggestion](https://github.com/srngx/my-devops-notes) anytime.
