- Iterative and incremental.
- Focus on collaboration and customer feedback.
- Pros: Flexibility, faster delivery, better quality.
- Cons: Requires close collaboration, may lack documentation.

# Agile Methodology
## üìå Introduction

The Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes iterative progress, continuous collaboration, adaptability and improvement . Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating.

Unlike traditional waterfall models, Agile promotes flexibility and continuous feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Principles of Agile

Agile is based on the **Agile Manifesto**, which prioritizes:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### üîÑ Agile Values

- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
- Welcoming changing requirements at any stage
- Frequent delivery of working software
- Close collaboration between business stakeholders and developers
- Self-organizing teams
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- Simplicity and efficiency in development

## üèóÔ∏è Agile Frameworks

Several frameworks follow Agile principles. Here are the most common ones:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scrum
Scrum is a lightweight framework with short development cycles known as **sprints**.

#### Key Components:

- **Scrum Team**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- **Events**: Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Kanban

A visual workflow management system that focuses on continuous delivery.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Work in Progress (WIP) limits** to prevent overload
- **Pull system** where new tasks are started only when capacity allows
- **Kanban Board** for tracking progress

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)

SAFe helps large enterprises implement Agile across multiple teams.

#### Key Features:

- Aligns business strategy with Agile execution
- Uses Agile Release Trains (ARTs) to synchronize work
- Supports Lean and DevOps principles

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Extreme Programming (XP)

XP is focused on engineering practices to improve software quality.

#### Best Practices:

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration
- Pair Programming
- Refactoring

## üîÅ Agile vs. Waterfall Methodology

| Feature       | Agile                         | Waterfall                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Flexibility   | High, adaptive to changes     | Rigid, sequential development |
| Approach      | Iterative and incremental     | Linear, phase-by-phase        |
| Delivery      | Continuous, in small releases | Single final delivery         |
| Collaboration | High involvement of customers | Limited customer involvement  |
| Risk Handling | Low, due to ongoing feedback  | High, as testing happens late |

## üéØ Agile Best Practices

- **Daily Stand-ups** to track progress and resolve issues quickly
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** for faster releases
- **User Stories & Story Points** to prioritize work effectively
- **Retrospectives** to continuously improve team processes
- **Automation** to reduce manual efforts and improve efficiency

---

## üìù Practical Hands-On Exercise
### Task 1: Create a Kanban Board

1. Use Trello/JIRA to create a **Kanban board**.
2. Add columns: **To-Do, In Progress, Done**.
3. Assign team members and track progress.

### Task 2: Conduct a Scrum Sprint Simulation

1. Choose a small project.
2. Define a **Product Backlog** with at least 5 user stories.
3. Run a **2-week sprint** and track progress using daily stand-ups.

## üéì Summary

Agile methodology helps teams deliver high-quality software efficiently by promoting collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. Popular frameworks like **Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe** provide structured ways to implement Agile in various environments.

üöÄ **Adopting Agile leads to faster development cycles, better stakeholder engagement, and improved project success rates!**

## Real-Life Day-to-Day API Examples

1. Booking a cab on Uber or Ola.
2. Payment processing via PayPal or Razorpay.
3. Fetching weather updates from a weather app.
4. Using maps for navigation (Google Maps).


## Frontend vs Backend: Understanding the Difference

- **Frontend**:
    - Visible part of an application.
    - Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    - Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.js.
- **Backend**:
    - Server-side logic and database management.
    - Technologies: Node.js, Python, Java.
    - Frameworks: Django, Spring, Express.js.

## Stages of Application Development

### Roles of Developer

- Write and debug code.
- Implement features as per requirements.

### Roles of Tester

- Test the application for bugs and performance issues.
- Ensure the application meets user expectations.

### Roles of Database Team

- Design and manage databases.
- Ensure data security and availability.

### Roles of DevOps Team

- Automate CI/CD pipelines.
- Manage infrastructure and deployment.
- Monitor and optimize application performance.
