# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
Waterfall vs Agile Model

# Waterfall Methodology

## Overview

The **Waterfall Model** is a sequential software development methodology where progress flows in one direction‚Äîlike a waterfall‚Äîthrough defined phases. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, ensuring a structured approach to software development.

## Phases of the Waterfall Model

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements Gathering & Analysis

- Understand and document user requirements.
- Outputs: Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ System Design

- Define the overall system architecture.
- Outputs: High-Level Design (HLD), Low-Level Design (LLD).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation (Coding)

- Convert design documents into actual code.
- Outputs: Developed software modules.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

- Identify and fix bugs.
- Outputs: Test Cases, Test Reports.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment

- Deploy the software in the live environment.
- Outputs: Release notes, Deployment reports.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Maintenance

- Fix issues and provide updates.
- Outputs: Bug fixes, Feature updates.

## Advantages ‚úÖ

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Clear documentation and well-defined phases.
- Best for projects with clear, stable requirements.

## Disadvantages ‚ùå

- Rigid, does not accommodate changes easily.
- Late testing phase may lead to expensive bug fixes.
- Not suitable for complex, evolving projects.

## When to Use Waterfall Model?

- When project requirements are **well-defined**.
- When changes are **unlikely** during development.
- For **small to medium-sized** projects.
## Comparison with Agile üìä

|Feature|Waterfall Model|Agile Model|
|---|---|---|
|Flexibility|Rigid|Highly flexible|
|Feedback|Late-stage|Continuous|
|Testing|After development|Throughout|
|Project Size|Small/Medium|Any size|
|Cost of Change|High|Low|

## Conclusion üéØ

The Waterfall Model is a structured, phase-driven methodology best suited for projects with **fixed requirements** and **predictable outcomes**. However, for projects requiring **flexibility and iterative feedback**, Agile or hybrid models may be more effective.
