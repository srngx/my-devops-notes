# My DevOps Notes

Hello, My name is *Sarang*, in this place I store my DevOps Notes, assignments and Practicals. Its not much but I like to keep track of everything I learned. 

This Place also acts like a **Second brain** kinda thing where I can always go back in time and recollect my old thoughts and Ideas or Notes in this case. Its not perfect and thats the beauty of it. I like to keep it this way original and imperfect. 

In this **Digital Garden** you are always welcome to explore and share your notes too if you want or [contribute/give suggestion](https://github.com/srngx/my-devops-notes) anytime.

*These notes are made using [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md) - A Markdown Notetaking App and Hosted with [Cloudflare page](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and compiled into html with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)*
